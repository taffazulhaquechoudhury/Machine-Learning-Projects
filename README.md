Project 1. From Data given it is required to develop the model to predict the profit of the company. Dataset file name: Companies-profit.csv Task: 1) Load the dataset 2) Analyse the data visually and give justification for selecting a particular algorithm for developing the model. 3) Split it into test and train. 4) Develop a model for predicting the profit of the company 5) Measure all the parameters of the model 6) Measure the performance of the model  
Project 2 Datasets for Disease operation is provided. Dataset file name: Disease.csv 1. Load the dataset and split it into test and train. 2. Analyse the Data Visually. 3. Find limitation with data if any in developing the model 4. Develop the model to identify whether operation successful or not using Decision Tree algorithm 5. Measure the performance of the model 6. Try to improvise the model by suitable technique. 7. Measure the performance of the model 
Project 3 Use iris flower dataset from sklearn library and try to form clusters of flowers using petal width and length features. • Analyse the Data Visually before training • Drop other two features for simplicity. • Try to Use K Mean Clustering • Analyse the Data Visually by comparing before and after the training.
